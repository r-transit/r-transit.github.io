## r-transit.org

As a public resource, the goals of transit align well with open source-tools for understanding it. 

Our goal is to provide support to--and highlight work by--those seeking to build public-domain tools and data in R that contribute to policy discussions around transit.  

### Tools

- [how-to](https://howto.r-transit.org)  
- [trread](https://github.com/r-transit/trread)  
- [bustt](https://github.com/r-transit/bustt)  
- [gtsf](https://github.com/r-transit/gtsf)  
- [r511](https://github.com/r-transit/r511)

### Contributing

Thanks for visiting. Our mission is immodest relative to our resources. Please consider contributing by [opening an issue](https://github.com/r-transit/r-transit.org/issues) with questions or proposals. 

### Acknowledgements

This organization and the tools in it take their inspiration (and a good deal of code!) from the [ROpenSci gtfsr](https://github.com/ropensci/gtfsr) package. We are grateful to ROpenSci and [the contributors](https://github.com/ropensci/gtfsr/graphs/contributors) to that package. 

As such, the commit history of that package has been included in all of the packages above as an acknowledgement of how, specifically, these tools are derived from them. Our intention here was to build smaller, simpler components that can be maintained by multiple people more easily. If youâ€™re interested in contributing or taking ownership of one of these packages, please open an issue in one of them.
