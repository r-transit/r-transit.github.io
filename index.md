## r-transit.org

The goals of public transit align well with the goals of open source-tools for understanding it. 

Our goal is to provide support to--and highlight work by--those building public-domain tools and data in R that contribute to policy discussions around transit.  

### R Packages

  * reading General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data into a list of R dataframes. 
  * analyzing the headways and frequencies at routes and stops. 
  * creating maps and performing spatial analysis on the routes and stops (using 'sf')

- [gtfsio](https://github.com/r-transit/gtfsio) - [in development] For:
  * Read and Write General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS)
