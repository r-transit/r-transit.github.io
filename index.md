## r-transit.org

The goals of public transit align well with the goals of open source-tools for understanding it. 

Our goal is to provide support to--and highlight work by--those building public-domain tools and data in R that contribute to policy discussions around transit.  

### R Packages
- [tidytransit](https://github.com/r-transit/tidytransit) - Use tidytransit to map transit stops and routes, calculate travel times and transit frequencies, and validate transit feeds. tidytransit reads the General Transit Feed Specification into tidyverse and simple features data frames. Please see the associated Vignettes for example use:
  * [tutorial](http://tidytransit.r-transit.org/articles/introduction.html) 
  * [introduction to service patterns](http://tidytransit.r-transit.org/articles/servicepatterns.html)
  * [introduction to time tables](http://tidytransit.r-transit.org/articles/timetable.html)
  * [introduction to frequency calculation](http://tidytransit.r-transit.org/articles/frequency.html) 

- [gtfsio](https://github.com/r-transit/gtfsio) - [in development] For:
  * Read and Write General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS)
